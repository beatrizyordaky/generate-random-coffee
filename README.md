# Random Coffee Generator

â˜• A Random Coffee Pair Generator implemented with Google Apps Script for Google Sheets.

---

## Overview

**generateRandomCoffee** helps teams randomly pair participants for informal coffee chats, promoting connection and collaboration. The script reads a list of participants from a Google Sheet, generates unique pairs while avoiding repeats based on previous pairings, and outputs the new pairs directly into the sheet.

---

## Features

- Randomly pairs participants from a list  
- Avoids repeating previous pairs  
- Supports dynamic participant lists  
- Handles odd numbers of participants with a notification  
- Highlights special messages (e.g., unpaired participant) with formatting  
- Automatically logs new pairs to a history sheet

## Google Sheets Setup

Create a Google Sheet with the following sheets and columns:

### Participants

| Name        |
|-------------|
| Alice Smith |
| Bob Jones   |
| ...         |

*List of participants starting at cell A2*

### PreviousPairs

| Name 1     | Name 2     |
|------------|------------|
| Alice Smith| Bob Jones  |
| ...        | ...        |

*Historical record of all previous pairs*

### NewPairs

*This sheet will be created or overwritten by the script to show the new pairs.*
